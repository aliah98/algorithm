Lab sheets for algorithm and complexity module

al_sem2_lab3: Breadth first search and depth first search in a graph
al_sem2_lab5: Hashing, using linear probing and double hashing. Works for a string of characters in lower case, without space, symbols and numbers. Can do insert and search hash table
al_sem2_lab5_q3: Hashing IDs of a list of employees, either with linear probing or double hashing (SHOULD also do separate chaining, maybe later...)
al_sem2_labBinaryTree: In a Binary tree can add node, search, max & min nodes, remove node, print using preorder, postorder, inorder traversal methods
